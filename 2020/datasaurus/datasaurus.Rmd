## Datasaurus Introduction

I recently came across the **Datasaurus** dataset by Alberto Cairo on [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-10-13/readme.md) and wanted to create a series of charts illustrating the lessons associated with this dataset, primarily to: [never trust summary statistics alone](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html).

First, some context. Here's Alberto's [original tweet](https://twitter.com/albertocairo/status/765167969139765250) from years ago when he created this dataset:

This tweet alone doesn't communicate why we shouldn't trust summary statistics alone, so let's unpack this. First we'll load the various packages and data we'll use.

## Load Packages

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(ggridges)
```

## Load Data

**note** : `datasaurus` and `datasaurus_dozen` are identical. The former is provided via #TidyTuesday, the latter from [this research paper](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs) discussing more advanced concepts beyond the scope of this document (i.e., simulated annealing). 

You'll also note that `datasaurus_dozen` and `datasaurus_wide` are the same data, organized differently. The former in *long* format and the latter, in *wide* format - see here for [details](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_data_between_wide_and_long_format/).

We'll use **both** `datasaurus_dozen` and `datasaurus_wide` throughout this document.

```{r data}
datasaurus <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-10-13/datasaurus.csv')
datasaurus_dozen <- read_tsv('DatasaurusDozen.tsv')
datasaurus_wide <- read_tsv('DatasaurusDozen-wide.tsv')
```

## Eyeballing the data

Here are the first six rows of `datasaurus_dozen` (long):

```{r long, echo=FALSE}
head(datasaurus_dozen)
```

Here are the first six rows of `datasaurus_wide` (wide):

```{r wide, echo=FALSE}
head(datasaurus_wide)
```

There are 13 variables, each with X- and Y- axes.

## Summary Statistics

First, we'll note that if we just look at summary statistics (i.e., **mean** and **standard deviation**), we might conclude that these variables are all the *same*. Moreover, within each variable, `x` and `y` values have very **similarly low correlations** at ranging from -0.06 to -0.07.

```{r summary}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
    group_by(dataset) %>%
    summarize(
        x_mean = mean(x),
        x_sd = sd(x),
        y_mean = mean(y),
        y_sd = sd(y),
        corr = cor(x,y)
    )
```

## Boxplots

You could use `boxplots` to show *slight* variation in the distribution and **median** values of these 13 variables. However, the **mean** values, indicated with the red circles, are identical.

```{r boxplot_x}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = dataset, y = x, fill = dataset)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6) +
    stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 6, color = "red", fill = "red") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = 'none') +
    labs(
        y = '13 variables',
        x = 'X-values',
        title = "Boxplots: Slight differences in the distribution and median values (X-axis)",
        subtitle = "Identical mean values"
    )
```

Here's the same plot for `y` values:

```{r boxplot_y}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = dataset, y = y, fill = dataset)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6) +
    stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 6, color = "red", fill = "red") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = 'none') +
    labs(
        y = '13 variables',
        x = 'Y-values',
        title = "Boxplots: Slight differences in the distribution and median values (Y-axis)",
        subtitle = "Identical mean values"
    )
```

## Ridgeline Plot

We can begin to get a sense for how these variables are different if we plot the distribution in different ways. The ridgeline plot begins to reveal aspects of the data that were hidden before.

We can begin to see that certain variables have markedly different distribution shapes (i.e., `v_lines`, `dots`, `x_shape`, `wide_lines`).

```{r ridgeline_x}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = dataset, fill = dataset)) +
    geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, quantile_lines = T, quantile_fun = mean) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c('#a6cee3', '#1f78b4', '#b2df8a', '#33a02c', '#fb9a99', '#e31a1c', '#fdbf6f', '#ff7f00', '#cab2d6', '#6a3d9a', '#ffff99', '#b15928', 'grey')) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = 'none') +
    labs(
        x = "X-values",
        y = "13 variables",
        title = "Ridgeline Plot: More variation in the distribution (X-axis)",
        subtitle = "Identical mean values"
    )
```

For `y` values, `high_lines`, `dots`, `circle` and `star` have obviously different distributions from the rest. Again, the **mean** values are identical across variables.

```{r ridgeline_y}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = y, y = dataset, fill = dataset)) +
    geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, quantile_lines = T, quantile_fun = mean) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c('#a6cee3', '#1f78b4', '#b2df8a', '#33a02c', '#fb9a99', '#e31a1c', '#fdbf6f', '#ff7f00', '#cab2d6', '#6a3d9a', '#ffff99', '#b15928', 'grey')) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = 'none') +
    labs(
        x = "Y-values",
        y = "13 variables",
        title = "Ridgeline Plot: More variation in the distribution (Y-axis)",
        subtitle = "Identical mean values"
    )
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
